### Hackathon

Unlike Zapier, which came [directly][2] from a hackathon the three founders attended, I
experienced the issue **Thia** eventually was created to solve at a hackathon with some friends _(although I didn't
know it at the time)_.

Let's set the stage ü•Å... It was an environment-based hackathon _(real original)_. Our idea? Users enter their address and get
an estimate on how much they could save on electricity if solar panels were installed on their house. Finding the amount
of sunlight falling at a location was easy to do, but as a second year student, I was utterly bewildered on how to get
the roof area of a house from satellite imagery.

In comes AutoML to the rescue!!

Using Google's AutoML service, we trained an object detection model to get an estimated bounding box of roofs using
top-down satellite imagery. While we didn't win any prizes, it was definitely fun... _until we got the bill_. **$495**.

### Stealth Mode

Let's say that the _slight inconvenience_ of having to pay the bill as a student made me a little irritated. So I spent a year
teaching myself machine learning and getting experience in it just so I could do what AutoML did, myself. In doing so, I
acquired a newfound passion. In addition to the many projects I did using my new knowledge, I worked with machine learning in
both the industry, and in research for over a year. At this point I was thinking that my career was going to go end up in machine
learning research. That was until I was talking with my friends about the hackathon I had done a year ago and the idea struck me:

_I've been training and using machine learning models on a commercial-grade GPU... so why isn't there an AutoML provider
that uses the **user's hardware**?_

I researched to see if this was viable ‚Äî technology wise. A week later, I was so sure of this venture that I immediately incorporated. A startup
in stealth mode is not considered to be a [good][4] decision. However, in this case I wasn't operating in stealth mode because I was afraid someone
would steal my idea. Rather, I was afraid that people would think my idea was stupid. I only told a select few friends and described the venture
as a "project", despite my intent of treating it like a business.

#### Timeline of Development:

-   Incorporated May 4th 2021 and started development.
-   _Proof of Technology_ finished September 2021 while working full-time.
-   No development was done between September - December 2021 due to taking a heavy course load and working part-time in research.
-   Resumed development on January 2022 with a lighter course load, still working part-time.
-   Finished development of prototype on May 2022.
-   Applied to incubators and accelerators.
-   Got denied.
-   Applied to some more :D.
-   Denied.

### Co Founder

Getting denied from accelerators as a startup is a normal occurrence. In my case it was due to not having any
user traction/customer validation. For **Thia**, we plan on adding a lot of helpful features such as more models, model deployments,
and _Remote Engine_ (allows you to use a virtual machine with a GPU instead of your own GPU ‚Äî which is useful if you don't have a GPU
on your machine). Actively developing these intricate features, especially being a full-time student, was going to be _difficult_ to
say the least. Something that would speed things up and help share the load? A co-founder.

#### Mission Impossible: Acquire a Co-Founder

A co-founder is a very vital component in your startup journey if you have one. They mitigate risk for potential investors, provide
support, and help you make tough calls. They are your analogue as they are in the same boat as you. Whatever pains your business
is going through, they feel it. Conversely, you have someone to celebrate with when your business is succeeding. Finding the
right co-founder however, is not a walk in the park.

Usually it goes something like this:

-   Make a list of everyone you know from high school, university, and work that codes and actually enjoys it.
-   Get to know them more. Hang out, grab a cofee, and see if they are someone you enjoy working with. If you're already friends
    with them, it makes this a whole lot easier.
-   Make them an offer. Equity. Equity + Salary if you can afford it. Make it a firm offer, no ambiguity.
-   Hopefully they accept. If not, repeat.

Very early on (about a month or two after I had the idea), I asked a friend of mine to join as a co-founder. They refused. Maybe it was
because I didn't have a working product yet. Maybe it was because they landed internships at really good tech companies and couldn't drop
them on just an idea _(sarcasm)_. I waited a year until I asked someone else ‚Äî till I had the prototype working. On **August 8th, 2022**
I asked a friend of mine from high school, [Lasitha][5], if he wanted to be a co-founder (he was helping me with the website for a month
or so at this point). He grasciously accepted!

### Now what?

When you launch a product with a website, you want to generate a lot of traffic on that website so potential users see your product _(duh)_.
This is largely done through marketting (we're broke, so not happening), SEO, inbound links, and from content that your website
contains (like blog posts). This blog post, that I've been trying to finish the past couple days, is the last step that is remaining
before we launch. What's next?

-   Get early adopters.
-   Forge a strong relationship with the early adopters.
-   Continue writing content to generate traffic.
-   Build cool features.
-   Praying... **lots** and **lots** of praying.
