## How It Works

### Overview

Thia is an AutoML application that runs on your own hardware instead of the cloud. It is installed
onto your Desktop and the Machine Learning **(ML)** takes place on your GPU. If you are on macOS, or don't
have a graphics processing unit **(GPU)**, it connects to a linux virtual machine from your preferred vendor
that does have one.

> **_NOTE:_** Currently Thia is only available on Windows and won't run if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU.
> We later plan to support other operating systems and linux virtual machines.

### Thia Workflow

<center>***Figure 1**: Thia model training/usage workflow*</center>

Thia is the hub where you:

-   Train your ML models.
-   Test your ML models.
-   Deploy your ML models.
-   Monitor your deployed ML models.

Because all of this is happening on your machine(s), **_you_** are in control of your own data. The app
communicates with our servers for authentication and authorization of ML tasks only.

> **_NOTE:_** You can only Train and Test your ML models with Thia. In future versions you will also be
> able to deploy your ML models and monitor them.

### Machine Requirements

The following are the required specifications, without which, the app will not function as intended:

-   Windows 10 or higher, 64 bit (Other operating systems will be supported in future releases.)
-   NVIDIA GPU (Preferrably above the 10 series.)
-   Recent NVIDIA Drivers.

The following are the minimum specifications (you may still encounter some issues and limitations):

-   NVIDIA GPU with 4 GB of video memory or more.
-   Intel / AMD CPU with 4 cores or more.
-   8 GB of RAM
-   5 GB of HDD free space.

The following are the reccomended specifications (you likely won't encounter issues):

-   NVIDIA GPU with 8 GB of video memory or more.
-   Intel / AMD CPU with 6 cores.
-   16 GB of RAM
-   10 GB of SSD free space.
