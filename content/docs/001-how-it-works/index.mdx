## How It Works

### Overview

Thia is an AutoML application that runs on your own hardware instead of the cloud. It is installed
onto your Desktop and the Machine Learning takes place on your GPU. If you are on macOS or don't
have a GPU, it connects to a linux virtual machine from your preferred vendor that does have one.

> **_NOTE:_** Currently Thia is only available on Windows and won't run if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU.
> We later plan to support other operating systems and linux virtual machines.

### Thia Workflow

Thia is the hub to train, serve, and monitor your Machine Learning models. Because all of this is happening on
your machine(s), **_you_** are in control of your own data. The app communicates with our servers for authentication
and authorization of tasks only.
