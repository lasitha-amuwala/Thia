Unlike other AutoML providers, you don't have to pay to use the core features of Thia. However, you will face limitations
from using the premium features and will have to deal with stricter quotas. It is **recommended** you start with the
free plan so you can decide whether our service is something you are willing to pay money for.

If you do decide to upgrade your plan the following is how to:

1. Visit your [dashboard][3].

4. Click the `Change plan` link.

6. Click `Continue`.
7. Review the changes and click `Confirm` to make the change.
