## (Optional) Select a plan

Unlike other AutoML providers, you don't have to pay to use the core features of Thia. However, you will face limitations
from using the premium features and will have to deal with stricter quotas. It is **recommended** you start with the
free plan so you can decide whether our service is something you are willing to pay money for.

> Navigate to the [pricing][2] page for a more information about the different plans and quotas.

If you do decide to upgrade (or downgrade) your plan the following is how to:

1. Visit the [billing][3] page.
2. If you do not have a payment method added:
    1. Click on the `Manage` button in the `Payment method` section.
    2. Click `Add a card`.
    3. Enter billing details and click on `Add card`.
3. Click on the `Upgrade` button for the plan you wish to upgrade to. (Or `Downgrade` button for the plan you wish to downgrade to).

Your billing period will be the date at which you first subscribed to a plan. You can visually view how long you have until the next billing date on the UI.
