# Creating An Image Classification Model

Here are the following steps to create an image classification model:

1. Navigate to the home page.
2. Click on `Create Model` button to open up the modal. ![Create Model Button][1]
3. Select the `IMAGE CLASSIFICATION` model.

    />
4. Fill in the model name.
    > **_Note_**: The model name must contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores - no whitespace.
5. Select the model size. Click [here][2] to learn more about the different model sizes.
6. Select the labelling type. Click [here][3] to learn more about the different labelling types.

## Model Size

Here are some quick differences between the different model sizes:

| Model Size  | Disk Space (MB) | Latency (ms) | Relative Accuracy |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Extra Small | 14              | 10           | 0.83x             |
| Small       | 24              | 80           | 0.88x             |
| Medium      | 96              | 120          | 0.9x              |
| Large       | 128             | 489          | 0.95x             |
| Extra Large | 240             | 1044         | 1x                |

### Extra Small

An extra small model is extremely small in size and uses a simpler internal architecture, resulting in it being extremely fast.
The low latency comes with a drawback of it being more inaccurate in comparison to the larger models. Because of this it is best suited for:

-   Android devices
-   iOS devices
-   Computers **without** a GPU
-   Edge devices:
    -   Microcontrollers (e.g Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense)
    -   Single-board computers **without** a hardware accelerator (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
    -   Single-board computers **with** a harware accelerator (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson devices)
    -   Vision processing units (e.g. Intel Neural Computing Stick)
    -   Tensor Processing Unit (e.g. Google Coral Edge TPU)
-   Extremely high-throughput business needs

> **Note**: Throughput refers to as number of data inputs a model can process in one unit of time. In this case it refers to images/second where a higher
> throughput model can process more images in a less amount of time.

### Small

A small model is smaller in size and uses a simple internal architecture, resulting in it being fast. The reduced latency
comes at the cost of it being slightly more inaccurate in comparison to the larger models. Because of this it is best suited for:

-   Computers **with** a low-end GPU
-   Edge devices:
    -   Single-board computers **with** a harware accelerator (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson devices)
    -   Vision processing units (e.g. Intel Neural Computing Stick)
    -   Tensor Processing Unit (e.g. Google Coral Edge TPU)
-   High-throughput / real-time business needs

### Medium

A medium model is in the middle in terms of size, latency, and accuracy. Because of this it is best suited for:

-   Computers **with** a low-to-mid range GPU
-   Balance between throughput and accuracy

### Large

A large model is larger in size and uses a complex internal architecture, resulting in it being accurate. The increasesd accuracy
comes at the cost of it being slightly slower in comparison to smaller models. Because of this it is best suited for:

-   Computers **with** a mid-to-high range GPU
-   High-accuracy business needs

### Extra Large

An extra large model is extremely large in size and uses a more complex internal architecture, resulting in it being extremely accurate.
The high accuracy comes at the cost of being slower in comparison to smaller models. Because of this it is best suited for:

-   Computers **with** a high-end GPU
-   Accuracy-critical business needs

## Labelling Type

Image classification models can either have the inputs associated with a single label or multiple labels.
They differ in the way they deal with images that contain multiple objects.

### Single Label

In single label classification, each image is assigned a single label. Ex:

-   An image containing a cat will be labelled with a `cat` label.
-   An image containing a dog will be labelled with a `dog` label.
-   An image containing a cat **and** a dog will be labelled with either:
    -   `cat`
    -   `dog`
    -   another label entirely

### Multi Label

In multi-label classification, each image may be assigned to multiple labels. Ex:

-   An image containing a cat will be labelled with a `cat` label.
-   An image containing a dog will be labelled with a `dog` label.
-   An image that contains a cat and a dog will be labelled with both `cat` **and** `dog`.
