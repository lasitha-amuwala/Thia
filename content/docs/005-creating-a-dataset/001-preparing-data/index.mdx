## Preparing Data

### Gathering Data

Having accurate and balanced machine learning models depends heavily on the quality of the data you train the model on.
All datasets are flawed to some degree, but having a more representative dataset makes our job easier.
Here are our **recommendations** when gathering data:

-   The data should be as close as possible to the data that predictions will be made on. Ex:
    -   If you're going to be making predictions on live traffic video with a low-bandwith connection, the frames will be blurry and low-resolution.
        Likewise, your dataset should be composed of blurry and low-resolution traffic data.
    -   Don't worry too much about the correct orientation of the data as we perform image rotations as a part of our [data augmentation][3] pipeline.
-   Have dataset to be as Independent and Identically Distributed (**I.I.D**) as possible. See [below][4] for more details.
-   Thia ML models can't predict labels that you yourself cannot assign. As a rule of thumb, if you can't decipher the label of an image in 1-2 seconds,
    consider not adding the image to the dataset.
-   The more images per label you have, the better the model is able to learn. As a rule of thumb, you should have **500 images** per label for
    [single label][1] classification and **1000 images** per label for [multi label][2] classification.
-   Thia ML models struggle training on very low frequency labels and on datasets with large class imbalances. As a rule of thumb, if there more than 100 times more
    images for the most common label than for the least common label, consider deleting the least common label.

#### I.I.D

I.I.D means that:

-   Samples from the dataset should be independent from one another. Ex: when flipping a coin, the probability of getting heads
    does not depend on the previous flips of the coin.
-   Samples should be come from the same probability distribution to be identically distributed. Ex: flipping a coin is identical
    because every sample comes from the same distribution (there is no change in distribution when we flip a coin.)

> A collection of random variables are independent and identically distributed if each random variable has the same
> probability distribution as the others and are all mutually independent

But what does this mean for image classification datasets? How do we have our dataset be I.I.D?

-   Provide data from multiple angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds.
-   If the classes of a dataset are real-life objects try to include as many variations of that object (old, young, broken, etc) as you can.

### Image Specifications

The following images formats are supported when creating a dataset:

-   JPEG / JPG
-   PNG

The following image formats are supported when testing a trained model:

-   JPEG / JPG
-   PNG

> **Note**: When training, all images are converted into JPG format regardless because it has a reduced file size.
> More image formats will be supported in future releases.

While we don't restrict the sizes of images in your dataset, we recommend not exceeding **25 MB** as it can end up
slowing down the app when viewing your dataset.
