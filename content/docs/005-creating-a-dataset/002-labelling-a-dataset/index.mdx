# Labelling A Dataset

## Creating A New Dataset

The following are the steps to create an image classification dataset:

1. Navigate to the model you wish to train by selecting it in the `Models` page.
2. If missing a dataset, create one by clicking `Add` in the `Datasets` section, then fill in the dataset name.
   ![Add Dataset][1]
   ![Create Dataset][2]

    > **_Note_**: The dataset name must contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores - no whitespace.

## Adding Images To A Dataset

The following are the steps to add images an existing image classification dataset:

1. Navigate to the model you wish to train by selecting it in the `Models` page.
2. Navigate to the respective dataset page by clicking on `Edit`.
   ![Edit Dataset][3]
3. Add images to your dataset to be uploaded by either selecting the images manually or if your images are in a single folder, select the folder that contains all the images.
4. It is best to review the images before you upload. Click the trash icon to remove an image from being uploaded. Once ready, click the `Upload` button to upload the images.

## Labelling Images Of A Dataset

Once you've uploaded images to your dataset, it's time to label them. The following are
the steps to label the images of an existing image classification dataset:

1. Navigate to the respective dataset page by clicking on `Edit`.
2. Add the labels for your dataset.
   ![Add Label][6]
    > **_Note_**: The label name must contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores - no whitespace.
3. An image will be `unlabelled` by default, to label a selected image click the respective label on the right panel.
   ![Add Label][7]
4. Continue labelling the rest of the images. Use the `>` button to navigate to the next page and use the `<` button to navigate to the previous page.

> **_Note_**: We understand that labelling all images one by one is extremely boring. Our **next** release will allow you to submit label files.

## Advance Labelling Tips

Labelling is a tedious process. We've added some shortcuts to make the experience smoother.

### Navigating Through The Dataset

Instead of clicking each image to navigate to it, use arrow keys `←` and `→` to navigate between images _(automatically changes pages as well)_.

### Assigning Labels Shortcuts

To assign the selected image a label, press the number on the keyboard corresponding to the label's order. Ex:  
To assign the current image with the `dog` category, press `1` on the keyboard.

> **_Note_**: You can drag and drop the labels in the left panel to change their order for the shortcut.
