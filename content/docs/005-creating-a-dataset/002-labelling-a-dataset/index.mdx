# Labelling A Dataset

## Creating A New Dataset

The following are the steps to create an image classification dataset:

1. Navigate to the model you wish to train by selecting it in the `Models` page.
2. If missing a dataset, create one by clicking `Add` in the `Datasets` section, then fill in the dataset name.
   ![Add Dataset][1]
   ![Create Dataset][2]

    > **_Note_**: The dataset name must contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores - no whitespace.

## Adding Images To A Dataset

The following are the steps to add images an existing image classification dataset:

1. Navigate to the model you wish to train by selecting it in the `Models` page.
2. Navigate to the respective dataset page by clicking on `Edit`.
   ![Edit Dataset][3]
3. Add images to your dataset to be uploaded by either selecting the images manually or if your images are in a single folder, select the folder that contains all the images.
4. It is best to review the images before you upload. Click the trash icon to remove an image from being uploaded. Once ready, click the `Upload` button to upload the images.
   ![Upload Images][4]
5. While uploading the images, you can view it's progress as well.

## Labelling Images Of A Dataset

Once you've uploaded images to your dataset, it's time to label them. The following are
the steps to label the images of an existing image classification dataset:

1. Navigate to the respective dataset page by clicking on `Edit`.
2. Add the labels for your dataset.
   ![Add Label][6]
    > **_Note_**: The label name must contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores - no whitespace.
3. An image will be `unlabelled` by default, to label a selected image click the respective label on the right panel.
   ![Add Label][7]
4. Continue labelling the rest of the images. Use the `>` button to navigate to the next page and use the `<` button to navigate to the previous page.

> **_Note_**: We understand that labelling all images one by one is extremely boring. Our **next** release will allow you to submit label files.

### Advance Labelling Tips

We've added some shortcuts to make labelling experience smoother.

#### Navigating Through The Dataset

Instead of clicking each image to navigate to it, use arrow keys `←` and `→` to navigate between images _(automatically changes pages as well)_.

#### Assigning Labels Shortcuts

To assign the selected image a label, press the number on the keyboard corresponding to the label's order. Ex:  
To assign the current image with the `dog` category, press `1` on the keyboard.

![Label Image Shortcut][8]

> **_Note_**: You can drag and drop the labels in the left panel to change their order for the shortcut.

## Batch Labelling

Labelling images one-by-one is a tedious process. If you already have the labels of your dataset you can quickly label the
dataset by uploading the label file. See [below][12] for the format of the label file.

1. Navigate to the respective dataset page.
2. Click on the `Dataset Batch Labelling` button to open the Batch Labelling dialog.
   ![Batch Labelling][9]
3. Drag and drop the label file.
   ![Drag and Drop Label File][10]
4. Upload the file and wait for the batch labelling to finish. It may take a few minutes to an hour depending on the size of
   your dataset, progress is visible through a progress bar.
   ![Drag and Drop Label File Progress][11]
    > **Note**: Make sure you have all the labels in your label file added to the dataset or else it won't work

### Label File Format

The label file is a JSON file representing an object with the keys being the file name _(without the extension)_ and the value being its corresponding label. For example:

```JSON
{
  "cat.1": "cat",
  "cat.2": "cat",
  "cat.3": "cat",
  "cat.4": "cat",
  "cat.5": "cat",
  "dog.1": "dog",
  "dog.2": "dog",
  "dog.3": "dog",
  "dog.4": "dog",
  "dog.5": "dog",
  // ...
}
```

If your images are stored in separate folders by class name like:

```less
main_directory/
...cat/
......cat.1.jpg
......cat.2.jpg
...dog/
......dog.1.jpg
......dog.2.jpg
```

Running the following script with `python script.py path/to/main_directory` will generate a `labels.json` file automatically:

```python
import argparse
import os
from pathlib import Path
import json


def main(directory: str):
    dir_path = Path(directory)
    if not dir_path.is_dir():
        raise Exception("Directory is not a valid directory")
    labels = {}
    for label_dir_path in dir_path.iterdir():
        if label_dir_path.is_dir():
            label = label_dir_path.stem
            for image_path in label_dir_path.iterdir():
                labels[image_path.stem] = label
    with open('labels.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        json.dump(labels, f, indent=4)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate JSON labels file from images in a directory')
    parser.add_argument('directory', help='Directory of images')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args.directory)
```
