# Training A Model

After having [created and labelled][1] a dataset, the next step is to train it. Training a model can take several minutes to
an hour to complete. The length of training depends on:

-   Size of dataset (larger datasets take longer to train).
-   Size of model (larger models take longer to train).
-   GPU (more performant GPUs take less time to train).

The following are the steps to train an image classification model:

1.  Navigate to the model page for the model you wish to train.
2.  Select a dataset you wish to train the model on by clicking on it.
3.  Click the `Train` button once a dataset is selected.

> **Note**: Once a model is trained without errors, it cannot be retrained. If you gather more data and wish to retrain,
> you will have to create another model. In future releases, you will be able to retrain.

## Training Graphs

When training you are able to view training graphs that are updated live. They represent how
the training process is going.

### Training Progress

The current training status is displayed at the top of the training section. It contains:
![Training Progress][3]

-   `Training status`. Possible statuses:
    -   `STARTING_TRAINING`
    -   `TRAINING`
    -   `TRAINED`
    -   `EVALUATING`
    -   `EVALUATED`
    -   `ERROR`
-   `Epoch`, if model is currently training. _Epoch represents one complete pass of the model training process. You can think of it as one step in the training process._
-   `Training description`, if model is currently training.

### Accuracy Log

The accuracy graph contains the history of how the model's training and validation accuracy have changed throughout the training process.
A larger accuracy value represents a higher-quality model. Click [here][5] to learn more about accuracy.
![Accuracy vs Epochs Graph][4]

### Loss

The loss graph contains the history of how the model's training and validation log-loss have changed throughout the training process.
A lower log-loss value represents a higher-quality model. Click [here][6] to learn more about log-loss.
![Loss vs Epochs Graph][7]

Thia chooses the **best** model which corresponds to the lowest validation log-loss.

## Errors

When an error is encountered during the training process, it is displayed on the training status.
![Training Status Error][8]

More info about the error can be viewed in the `Recent Activity` panel in the `Home` page.
![Recent Activity Panel for Training Error][9]

Some reasons for the error:

-   Model may be too large for the GPU on your computer
-   GPU is currently being used in other GPU-intensive processes.
-   An Operation Error occurred during training (very unlikely, happens more often with older GPU, out-of-date
    drivers, or a corrupted dataset).

Because of the large support for the [different GPUs][10] Thia offers, not all models will be trainable on a given GPU due to the
the amount of Video RAM (VRAM) that is available on it. We try various configs when training to get the most out of the resources
available but sometimes it is not enough. In cases like this, try again with a smaller model.

### Retraining A Model

As mentioned above, a model cannot be retrained unless the previous training encountered an error. If a model continues to fail
training due to an Operation Error, consider training it on another dataset as the dataset you have been training on might have
been corrupted during creation.
