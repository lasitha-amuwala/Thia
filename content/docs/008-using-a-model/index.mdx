## Using A Model

### Exporting A Model

The first step to using a model is to export it. You can currently export it in the following formats:

-   TensorFlow Lite (used on mobile / edge devices)
-   TensorFlow SavedModel (used on a computer / Docker container)

> **Note**: We are currently adding support for TensorFlow.js and Edge TPU compiled TensorFlow Lite

**To export a model**:

1.  Navigate to the model you wish to train by selecting it in the `Models` page.
2.  Scroll down to the `Export` section.
    ![Export Model UI][1]
3.  Click the preferred export method and select the folder you wish to export to.
    ![Select Export Folder][2]
4.  Wait till the model is finished exporting.

### Downloading Class List

Each prediction is a value from `0` to `Number of classes - 1`. To download the class list for a trained model:

1. Navigate to the model you wish to train by selecting it in the `Models` page.

### Using A SavedModel

Depending on the model size, you will need to resize the images you are running inference on, to a different size.
Refer to the following table:

| **Model Size** | **Input Image Resolution (px)** |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Extra Small    | 224 x 224                       |
| Small          | 300 x 300                       |
| Medium         | 384 x 384                       |
| Large          | 480 x 480                       |
| Extra Large    | 480 x 480                       |

```py
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load images you want to run predictions on
# Even if it is one image, keep the path in an array
image_paths = ['path/to/image1.jpg', 'path/to/image2.jpg', ...]
image_batch = []
# Must be a tuple, refer above to the resolution depending on your model size
image_size = (224, 224)
for image_path in image_paths:
    # Load the image using your preferred method, we use PIL
    with Image.open(image_path) as img:
        # Convert the image to be RGB format if not already
        # Can't use images in RGBA as it contains 4 channels,
        # and we only need the color channels
        if img.format != 'JPEG':
            img = img.convert('RGB')
        # Resize image to the corresponding resolution mentioned above
        img = img.resize(image_size, Image.NEAREST)
        image_batch.append(np.asarray(img))

# Convert image_batch to a TensorFlow Tensor
image_batch = np.array(image_batch)
image_batch_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image_batch)

# Load the model
model_path = 'path/to/your/model/folder'
model: tf.keras.Model = load_model(model_path)

# Make the predictions
predictions = model(image_batch_tensor)
predictions = predictions.numpy()
# Convert predictions to a 1-D array with each element representing the prediction
# for each image in the image_batch
predictions = predictions.argmax(axis=1)

print(predictions)
# [0, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0, ...]
```
