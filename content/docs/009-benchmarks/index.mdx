# Benchmarks

We have evaluated on a variety of different datasets across all 5 of our image classification model sizes.
The datasets are varied in number of classes, number of images, and the different classification industries
(e.g. medicine, agriculture, animals, etc).

> **Note:** All training was performed on a MSI RTX 3080 with 8GB of VRAM

#### Deciding Which Model Size To Train On

Smaller models are faster and less accurate, but with smaller datasets and lower number of classes,
smaller models can surpass larger models in accuracy.

## Summary of Datasets

| **Dataset Name**      | **Num Classes** | **Num Images** |
| --------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| ASIRRA (Cats vs Dogs) | 2               | 25,000         |

### ASIRRA Dataset (Cats vs Dogs)

[ASIRRA][1] (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access) is a CAPTCHA that works by asking users to identify
photographs of cats and dogs. The original dataset consists of over three million images of cats and dogs. [This][2] dataset
however, is a subset of the original with 25 thousand images (divided evenly between the two classes).
