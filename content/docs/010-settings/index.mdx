# Settings

In the App, you can access **Settings** by clicking on the page in the side menu. Here are the settings you can access and what they do.

## Light/Dark Mode

You can change the color theme in the App from light to dark by flipping the toggle switch (_we prefer dark_ ðŸ˜‰).

## Managing Model Cache

When training a model, one of the first thing we do is download that specific model metadata onto the disk. This is so that if you were to train another model
of that same type again, you won't need to download it's metadata again as it is cached onto the disk. You can, however, delete model cache for all models or specific
models if they are taking up too much space.
